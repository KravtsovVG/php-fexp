PHP File Exchange Platform (PHP-FEXP)
=====================================

This directory contains the (localized) resources that are used by the
PHP File Exchange Platform (HTML snippets, e-mail templates and text
labels/messages).

Should you need to modify those resources, please copy its content to some
other directory and update the 'dir_resources' configuration parameter
accordingly (see the sample 'config.php' for further information).

ATTENTION: This directory MUST be readable (but NOT writable) by PHP!
